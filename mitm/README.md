# MITM

This Machine-in-the-Middle's an AutoUpdate from RemoteMouse. You have to figure out a way to get `remotemouse.net` and `www.remotemouse.net` to resolve to your IP via some other means, that is out of scope for this code.

Simply install the requirements with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` and execute `sudo python3 webserver.py`. Then anyone will download your malicious executable. The source code for the executable is included, feel free to re-compile if you don't trust me :).
